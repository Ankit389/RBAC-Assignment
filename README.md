Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of secure Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms. It ensures that users are authenticated, assigned specific roles, and granted access to resources based on their roles. The system adheres to security best practices to provide a robust and flexible solution.

Features
Core Features
Authentication:

User registration with secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
Login system with JWT-based session management.
Secure logout functionality.
Authorization:

Access control based on roles such as Admin, User, and Moderator.
Route protection to ensure only authorized users can access specific endpoints.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Role assignment and permission-based access control.
Centralized role and permission management for scalability.
Additional Features:
Token expiry and refresh mechanisms for enhanced session security.
Modular code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
Error handling and validation to improve reliability.
Project Structure
Backend
Technology: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Features:
RESTful API endpoints for authentication and role management.
Middleware for route protection and role validation.
MongoDB for data storage (users, roles, permissions).
Run Backend:

bash
Copy code
npm install
npm start
Server URL:
http://localhost:8080

Frontend
Technology: React.js, Vite
Features:
User-friendly interfaces for registration, login, and role-based dashboards.
Integration with the backend for API communication.
Run Frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run dev
Client URL:
http://localhost:5173

API Endpoints
Authentication Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/auth/register	Register a new user
POST	/auth/login	Log in a user
POST	/auth/logout	Log out the current user
RBAC Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/roles	Fetch all roles
POST	/roles	Create a new role
POST	/roles/assign	Assign a role to a user
GET	/protected	Access role-protected resource
Roles and Permissions
Role	Permissions
Admin	Full access to all resources
User	Access to general user-related resources
Moderator	Access to moderate content or users
Security Features
Password Hashing: Ensures user passwords are stored securely using bcrypt.
JWT Authentication: Stateless and secure token-based authentication.
Route Protection: Middleware to validate tokens and enforce role-based access.
How to Use
Backend:

Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder.
Install dependencies and start the server:
bash
Copy code
npm install
npm start
The backend will be available at http://localhost:8080.
Frontend:

Clone the repository and navigate to the frontend folder.
Install dependencies and start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run dev
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.
Screenshots
Add screenshots of the registration, login, and role management interfaces.

Future Improvements
Add two-factor authentication (2FA) for additional security.
Implement OAuth integration for social logins.
Create an admin dashboard for managing users and roles.
Add unit and integration tests for API endpoints.
